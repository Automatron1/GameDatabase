# GameDatabase
This Database is a project myself Ben Gordon and Harrison Noble are working on. We are working on creating an easier way for Indie games to be discovered through
the XBOX GamePass. We are looking at bringing other game databases in later this year and hope to have the application available later in the year for public use.
